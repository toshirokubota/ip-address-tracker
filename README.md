- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I was able to integrate both IPify and leaflet.js into my project. Both libraries were easy to use and have good documentations.

### Continued development

I want to get more comfortable with promises and asynchronous programming. I often find myself thinking in synchronous ways and run into some issues interacting with promises.

### Useful resources

I googled for some famous static ip addresses and found this quora post.
https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-famous-IP-addresses. I used them to test the app.
